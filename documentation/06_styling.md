# Style-Guide

We use [react-styleguidis](https://github.com/styleguidist/react-styleguidist) to generate a styleguide for the application. This tool will generate the styleguide which will not be checked into source-control but we'll regenerate this styleguide on our deployment server and serve it every time.
